I've made some [fast crabby number arrows](https://github.com/unic0rn9k/slas).

Also made an [exotic crabby brain](https://lib.rs/crates/exotic).

Take a look at [this brain](https://unic0rn9k.gitlab.io/brainctautoencoder/index.html) i made that draws brains badly.

I also made this [sadistik calculator](https://gitlab.com/unic0rn9k/mr-calculator) (only works on a few specific browsers atm).
