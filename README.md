üëã Hey there, I'm Aksel ‚Äì a 20-year-old programmer with an insatiable curiosity for turning abstract problems into elegant solutions.
I'm fresh out of high school, where I spent 3 years at Sukkertoppen HTX studying computer science.
I love working with everything from machine learning models in Torch to MPI and BLAS bindings in Rust.

Check out some of my more impressive projects:
- [Transformer implementation in PyTorch without using nn.Transformer](https://github.com/unic0rn9k/tiny-py-transformer)
- [reverse-mode, auto-differentiation graph](https://github.com/unic0rn9k/autodiff) in Rust, levereging Generic Associated Types.
- [Predicting PDF annotation labels](https://github.com/unic0rn9k/dsv_recruitment) in Julia using KNN and graph embeddings.
- [Rust implementation of the Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm](https://github.com/unic0rn9k/fourier-notebook).
- [Minimax Chess AI in Rust](https://github.com/Bechiscul/chess), complete with a JavaScript front-end and WASM magic. (This was a group project, where I focused on chess logic and the minimax model.)
- [Auto-encoder for generating brain images](https://gitlab.com/unic0rn9k/brainctautoencoder), employing Rust and WASM.
- [multithreaded & distributed async runtime](https://github.com/unic0rn9k/metalmorphosis) in Rust.

I prefer a methodical approach to coding and believe that shortcuts mostly end up being detours.
My ultimate aspiration is to contribute to the development of safe AGI someday, a challenging goal to pursue.
That's why I hold alternative ideas about motivation and finding meaning in life.
The oxymoron of hope is what drives perseverance when the odds of success are slim.
Perseverance should ideally be a matter of principle, independent of outcomes or motivations.

I hope you enjoyed learning a bit about me and what motivates me.
Feel free to connect with me on linkedin or drop me an email if you'd like to get in touch!
