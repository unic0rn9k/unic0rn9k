üëã Hey there, I'm Aksel ‚Äì a 21-year-old programmer with an insatiable curiosity for turning abstract problems into elegant solutions.
I'm currently studying Machine Learning & Datascience at Copenhagens University, while working part time at an awesome startup.
I love working with everything from machine learning models in Torch, to MPI and BLAS bindings in Rust.

Check out some of my favorite projects:
- [Transformer decoder-block implementation (with backprop) in Julia only using standard library](https://github.com/unic0rn9k/shakespeare_from_scratch).
- [Transformer decoder-block reference implementation in PyTorch](https://github.com/unic0rn9k/tiny-py-transformer).
- [reverse-mode, auto-differentiation graph](https://github.com/unic0rn9k/autodiff) in Rust, levereging Generic Associated Types.
- [Predicting PDF annotation labels](https://github.com/unic0rn9k/dsv_recruitment) in Julia using KNN and graph embeddings.
- [Rust implementation of the Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm](https://github.com/unic0rn9k/fourier-notebook).
- [Minimax Chess AI in Rust](https://github.com/Bechiscul/chess), complete with a JavaScript front-end and WASM magic. (This was a group project, where I focused on chess logic and the minimax model.)
- [Auto-encoder for generating brain images](https://gitlab.com/unic0rn9k/brainctautoencoder), employing Rust and WASM.
- [multithreaded & distributed async runtime](https://github.com/unic0rn9k/metalmorphosis) in Rust.

I hope you enjoyed learning a bit about me and my projects.
