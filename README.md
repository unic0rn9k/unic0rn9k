I've made some [fast crabby number arrows](https://github.com/unic0rn9k/slas).
Also made an [exotic crabby brain](https://lib.rs/crates/exotic).
Take a look at [https://unic0rn9k.gitlab.io/brainctautoencoder/index.html](this brain) i made that draws brains badly.
I also made this [https://gitlab.com/unic0rn9k/mr-calculator](violent chess game) (only works on a few specific browsers atm).
