ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm Aksel â€“ a 20-year-old programming enthusiast with an insatiable curiosity for turning abstract problems into elegant solutions.
Im fresh out of highschool, where I did 3 years at sukkertoppen HTX computerscience.
I love playing with everything from machine learning models in tensorflow, to MPI and BLAS bindings in Rust.

Check out some of my more impresive projects:
- [Transformer implementation in pytorch, without nn.Transformer](https://github.com/unic0rn9k/tiny-py-transformer)
- [Compile-time, reverse-mode, auto-differentiation graph](https://github.com/unic0rn9k/autodiff) in Rust.
- [Predicting PDF annotation labels](https://github.com/unic0rn9k/dsv_recruitment) in Julia, using KNN and graph embeddings.
- [Rust implementation of the Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm](https://github.com/unic0rn9k/fourier-notebook).
- [Minimax Chess AI in Rust](https://github.com/Bechiscul/chess), complete with a Javascript front-end and WASM sorcery. (This was a group project, where I worked on the chess logic, and minimax model.)
- [Auto-encoder for generating brain images](https://gitlab.com/unic0rn9k/brainctautoencoder), employing Rust and WASM.
- [Zero-cost, multithreaded & distributed async runtime](https://github.com/unic0rn9k/metalmorphosis) in Rust.

I like to work methodically with code, and believe shortcuts mostly always end up being a detour.
I really wan't to be able to contribute to the development of safe AGI some day, which is a tough goal to strive for.
Thats why I have some alternative ideas on motivation, and what it means to have meaning in life.
The oxymoron of hope, is what drives perseverance when chances of succeeding are marginal.
Ideally perseverance should be a matter of prinicple, without reagard for outcome, nor motivation.

Hope you enjoyed reading a bit about me and what makes me tick.
