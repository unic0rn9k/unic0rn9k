👋 Hey there, I'm Aksel – a 20-year-young programming enthusiast with an insatiable curiosity for turning abstract problems into elegant solutions. I embarked on my programming journey at the mere age of 10, and I've been captivated by the world of coding ever since. Armed with a love for numbers and a knack for abstract thinking, I've developed a keen understanding of calculus, algebra, and statistics – tools I wield with precision in every coding adventure.

🎓 My education at HTX Sukkertoppen further fueled my passion. With a focus on computer science, I unleashed my creativity through a cascade of projects, both in the classroom and beyond. From whipping up intricate web designs for local boutiques to diving deep into the intricacies of algorithmic puzzles, I thrive on the thrill of creation and discovery.

🧠 Beyond coding, my life is a patchwork of eclectic experiences. I've gone from crafting delectable delicacies at Big Føtex to expertly maneuvering the streets as a Domino's pizza delivery dynamo. Not to forget, my days as a diligent paperboy – a journey that took me from delivering news to crafting my own in the world of programming.

🌟 My GitHub is my canvas, showcasing the tapestry of my technological adventures. Here are just a few brushstrokes:

- 🚀 I breathed life into Rust with a [compile-time, reverse-mode, auto-differentiation masterpiece](https://github.com/unic0rn9k/autodiff).
- 📚 Navigated the digital seas by [predicting PDF annotation labels](https://github.com/unic0rn9k/dsv_recruitment) using KNN and graph embeddings.
- 🎵 Played conductor with a [Rust rendition of the Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm](https://github.com/unic0rn9k/fourier-notebook).
- ♟️ Led a knight's charge with a [Minimax Chess AI in Rust](https://github.com/Bechiscul/chess), complete with a Javascript front-end and WASM sorcery.
- 🧠 Unveiled the enigma of the mind by creating an [auto-encoder for generating brain images](https://gitlab.com/unic0rn9k/brainctautoencoder), employing Rust and WASM wizardry.
- 🌐 Mastered the realm of asynchronous computation with my [zero-cost, multithreaded & distributed async runtime in Rust](https://github.com/unic0rn9k/metalmorphosis).

🛠️ My toolbox is as diverse as my adventures. From Rust and WASM and Julia to shell scripting and beyond, I'm a polyglot in pursuit of perfection. When I'm not crafting code, I'm unearthing hidden gems in the world of Arch and Neovim, and I'm not afraid to tread in the waters of BLAS, MPI, and CUDA.

🔍 My coding prowess extends beyond syntax. I'm the Sherlock of debugging, employing rigorous methodology to unravel the most perplexing tangles of code. I relish strong type systems, unit tests, and assertions as allies in my quest for optimal, correct, and elegant solutions.
